      <h2>The changing dynamics of modern-day cricket</h2>
      <p>Modern day cricket requires cricketers to play the game differently to the way it was played a decade ago. With the advent of Twenty20 (T20), things have changed drastically. The game has seen changes with the way players approach the game
        nowadays. Captains have become more aggressive and tactical in their approach. Bowlers are taken apart more often than not, but their desperation has bred evolution. We now see deliveries like the carom ball, the doosra, the off-cuter,
        various types of slower balls, and more. Fielding has become an extremely important aspect and we have seen some innovations even in fielding.</p>
